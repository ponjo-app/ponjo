An editor to co-author local text files with your human and AI buddies.

- **Real-time collaboration, humans and AI buddies together:** You and your AI buddies edit, comment and @mention in the same doc at the same time. No handoffs, no syncing between tools.
- **You are in control:** AI buddies work beside you through comments and edits. Every change an AI buddy makes is shown and can be undone in one click, so they never take over your doc.
- **Teammates in a browser:** Open a room on a project and send its link. Friends open it in a browser, with no install or account, and are in at once, reading or editing any doc in it with you, seeing who is here and where each person's cursor is. You set who may edit, kick or lock people out, and close the room when you are done. Your computer hosts the room, so it lasts while the project is open.
- **Open & private:** Open source, plain text files with an open comment format, and works with any command-line agent. Your docs stay on your machine: teammates' edits pass through a relay that stores nothing, and Ponjo keeps nothing on a server.

## Download

Nightly installers for macOS (`.dmg`) and Windows are on the [nightly release](https://github.com/ponjo-app/ponjo/releases/tag/nightly), rebuilt from `main` after every change that passes the checks. They are pre-release builds.

## Getting started

1. Install the app, or build it from source (see below).
2. Open a text file or a folder. Markdown files open in the Markdown editor, other text files as plain text.
3. Select some text, add a comment and @mention an AI buddy. Its reply and any edits show up in the doc as it works.

Buddies run on a command-line agent you already have, such as Claude Code or Codex. See [Agent Config](docs/agent-config.md) to set one up.

## Development

Requires Node 20 or later.

```bash
npm install
npm run build                 # bundle the editor into dist/web
npm run desktop               # build and launch the desktop app
npm run desktop -- path/to/doc.md   # open a doc (or a folder) directly
PONJO_RELAY=ws://127.0.0.1:8787 npm run desktop   # share through the relay run locally (`npx wrangler dev` in relay/, after the build), not wss://share.ponjo.app

npm run lint
npm ci --prefix relay         # once: wrangler, which runs the relay locally for the tests
npm test                      # unit and integration tests
npm run test:stress           # stress tests
npm run test:perf             # each view keeps its latency promise at its limits
npm run smoke:desktop         # launch the built app and check it

npm run pack:desktop          # unpacked app in release/
npm run dist:desktop          # installer in release/
```

### Deploying the relay

The relay and the teammate's page are one Cloudflare Worker at `share.ponjo.app` ([relay/wrangler.toml](relay/wrangler.toml)). CI deploys it with the nightly, from each push to `main` that passes the checks (`relay` in [desktop.yml](.github/workflows/desktop.yml), with the repo's `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets). To deploy it by hand, its owner works from a clean checkout of `main`, signed in to Cloudflare with wrangler (`npx wrangler login` in relay/, once):

```bash
npm ci && npm ci --prefix relay
cd relay
npm run deploy -- --dry-run  # check
npm run deploy               # builds the page it serves (dist/web), then deploys
```

Then check it on two machines: [the sharing checklist](docs/testing-ci.md#sharing--two-machines-by-hand).

### The preview's buddies

In the [online demo](https://ponjo.app/preview/), a buddy asked answers on NVIDIA Nemotron through the same Worker deployed as `ponjo-hackathon` at `infer.ponjo.app` (the `hackathon` env in [relay/wrangler.toml](relay/wrangler.toml)), which holds a [Nebius Token Factory](https://tokenfactory.nebius.com) key and picks the model. CI deploys it with the relay, the key from the repo's `TOKEN_FACTORY_KEY` secret; `npm test` runs it in front of a fake model (`test/infer.test.js`). [docs/nebius-hackathon.md](docs/nebius-hackathon.md) says how it uses them.
