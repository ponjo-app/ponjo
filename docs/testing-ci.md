# Testing and CI/CD (draft)

How Ponjo is tested and shipped, derived from
[architecture](architecture.md), [SPEC](../spec/SPEC.md),
[PROJECT](../spec/PROJECT.md) and [agent config](agent-config.md).
Each test guards a rule there; a test that guards none is not needed.

## Principles

1. **Test invariants, not code paths.** Lost text first, then everything
   else.
2. **The format is a contract.** Its tests are fixtures in
   `spec/conformance/` that any tool can run. Anchors run in Node and in the
   browser. The markdown editor's rendered text matches the markdown
   projection on fixtures and on every markdown file in the repository.
3. **Agents are always faked.** A fake agent script edits its copy and
   prints a reply. No test runs Claude Code, Codex or a model.
4. **Every platform, every PR.** Rename, scripts and process trees differ
   most on Windows.
5. **Real files and processes, fake time.** Integration tests use a temp
   folder, real child processes and an injected clock.

Layers: **unit** (pure, `src/core`), **integration** (DocService and
Runner on real files with the fake script, in the test process, standing in
for a window), **e2e** (the packaged app, under xvfb on Linux).

## Tests

### Format — unit, conformance

- Reading (§4): the first of duplicate ids kept; thread order; a reply
  without its first comment hidden; a thread resolved only when its latest
  comment says so.
- **Any order or duplication of lines reads to the same threads** (property
  test). This is what makes `merge=union` safe.
- Unknown major refused; a bad
  line reported, skipped and kept on rewrite; unknown fields kept.
- Writing (§5): the file replaced whole, never torn; only a human sets
  `resolved`.
- Mentions (§6): `@name` matches a buddy's name, case-insensitively.
- A doc's text: UTF-8 only, no byte order mark, LF; written back with its
  byte order mark and each line's end.
- Anchors on the doc's text: exact → context → fuzzy → detached; a thread
  on its latest anchor.

### Model — unit, property

- Three-way merge by line (`merge3`), fuzzed: **the human's lines always
  survive**; where both changed the same lines the other side's change is
  left out and counted; changes to other lines merge; the result is
  deterministic.
- Undo: each change of a run whose lines no one changed since is put back;
  lines changed since, by anyone, stay.
- The inbox: a thread waits on X only after a comment by this user that
  @mentions X, or mentions no one in a thread X opened or was @mentioned in;
  another user id asks no one, and neither does a comment this host did
  not take, or one changed since.
- Same fixtures, same output in Node and the browser.

### DocService — integration

- Writes one at a time; the disk checked before each; an outside write (an
  editor, `git pull`) merged, the typing winning where they overlap, the
  outside version saved.
- Versions saved before and after each buddy edit, before each outside
  change, undo and restore; each can be restored.
- Killed mid-write: the doc and sidecar are intact.
- Two git branches changing one sidecar, merged with `merge=union`, read to
  the expected threads.

### Runner — integration, fake script

- The script runs in a new folder holding only the copy, gets the prompt on
  stdin and `PONJO_DOC`, `PONJO_PROJECT` and `PONJO_BUDDY`, and its stdout becomes the
  reply; the folder is gone after.
- **The human edits the same lines during a run**: the human's text stays,
  and the turn runs once more on the doc as it is, told what it and they
  changed; colliding again, it lands where no one changed its lines, and
  its version says `conflict`; nothing asks the user.
- Two runs on one doc at once: both edits land, merged one at a time.
- Exit non-zero: the reply is marked `failed` with the end of the output;
  @mentioning again runs again; after a restart, unanswered asks run again.
- Runs only on docs open in a window.
- The shipped scripts, as text: each passes the project folder only when
  there is one, on `sh` and `.cmd`.

### Buddy files — unit, integration

- `<Name>.md`: the file name is the name, the text who it is; a
  renamed file is a renamed buddy;
  `.ponjo/` created with the first buddy; only the opened folder's counts.
- The user's buddies are the same in every doc and in their runs; doc
  mode reaches only them, also inside a project folder; a project's buddy
  wins over one of the user's with its name.
- The first run writes `Clippy.md` (id `Clippy`) once; then it is renamed,
  changed and deleted like any buddy.
- One agent script runs every buddy, with `PONJO_BUDDY` set;
  **nothing in `.ponjo/` or a sidecar chooses a program**.
- The same buddies have the same faces and colors everywhere; up to
  eight buddies all have different colors.

### App — e2e

- **No process outlives the app**, agent children included; the app listens
  on no port.
- One app per machine; a second launch hands its files to the first.
- The main flow: open a doc and a folder, @mention a buddy, the fake agent
  edits, Undo on its reply, Cmd+Z undoes only the human's edit, restore a version.

### Editing tests

One set of tests for the rules in [Editing](architecture.md#editing),
alone and shared alike: what changes is parameters, never the path. Every
test title starts with its rule id (`A3: a dropped line never lands an
edit twice`), and a check in `npm test` (`test/rules.test.js`) fails when
a rule id in that table has no test, unless its row says "No test yet".
Every editing bug fix comes with a test, named by its rule id,
that fails before the fix.

| Layer | Covers | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Properties of `src/core/ot.js` | A1 A3 A4 A5 | `npm test` |
| 2. Protocol fuzz | A1–A6, C1, C3–C5, C7 | `npm run test:stress` (`test/stress/concurrency.test.js`) |
| 3. Named scenarios in real views and pages | D1–D8, A2 A3 A4 A5 A6, B6, C1–C8 | `npm test` (`test/client.test.js`, `test/doc-service.test.js`, `test/runner.test.js`, `test/store.test.js`, `test/views.test.js`, `test/relay.test.js`) |
| 4. Timings | B1–B5, B7, B8 | `npm run test:perf` |
| 5. By hand | C5, C6 on a real network | [two machines](#sharing--two-machines-by-hand) |

- **Layer 2** runs a real DocService on temp files with 1 to 4 clients
  (`web/client.js`) over a fake line that can delay, drop the line (calls
  fail `offline`), lose an event, restart the host, fail a write (the file
  read-only), make an outside change, land a buddy's edit and change a
  level. Each seed makes a list of steps, run one at a time, so it runs
  the same every time. On a pull request, a fixed 300 seeds on Linux and
  Windows (a few minutes); nightly, 30 minutes of random seeds, as a
  scheduled run of the same `stress` job. A failing seed is shrunk to the
  fewest steps that still fail and printed; the pull request that fixes it
  adds them to `test/stress/regressions.json`, which every run replays.
  Another program adds lines and deletes lines that hold nothing typed;
  not yet: buddies, whose turns merge by line as another program's do.
- **Layer 3** runs each scenario for each other writer (a teammate, a
  buddy, an outside change) in each view (Markdown, Plain).
- **Layer 4**: `test/perf/latency.test.js` opens each view at its limits,
  in the doc shape that costs it most, and types while a teammate's edits
  arrive; `test/perf/typing.test.js` times each key the owner types to its
  character on a teammate's page (the browser build, its applyText and
  marks included) through the relay run locally, the teammate's line 40 ms
  slower each way, in a small Markdown doc and in the plain view's longest,
  which the host writes whole on every key; `test/perf/open.test.js`
  opens the desktop app on a folder and times a file clicked in the
  sidebar until its doc is drawn in place. A timing fails when it is
  missed three times running.
- Layers 1 to 3 are deterministic and never retried: a test that fails now
  and then is a bug.

### Sharing — two machines, by hand

After each deploy of the relay (README, Deploying the relay). The owner on
machine A runs the app from `main` with no `PONJO_RELAY`; the teammate is
on machine B, on another network (a phone's hotspot will do), in a browser.

1. **Open room.** A opens a project, Team > Open room, Copy link. The link
   is `https://share.ponjo.app/team?room=…`. B opens it, picks a name, and
   is in at once: the project's first doc, editable. B reloads: in at once.
2. **Players.** A's Team panel lists B, live.
3. **Both typing.** Both type in the same paragraph at once for a minute.
   Each sees the other's keys as they type; nothing is lost, and the file
   on A holds both. A sets B to Read: B's tools go; back to Edit.
4. **Sleep and wake.** A sleeps (close the lid) for two minutes. B goes
   read only and says the host went away. A wakes: within 30 seconds B is
   back in the doc by itself, with A's text, editable, and both type again.
5. **Idle.** Leave both untouched for ten minutes, then type: still live.
6. **Line down.** B turns its network off while typing: within 15 seconds
   B is read only and shows what it typed that did not reach A, to copy.
7. **Lock, kick, close.** A locks the room: a second browser on the link
   is turned away; B reloads and is in. A kicks B: B's page says so, and B
   cannot come back. A unlocks; B in a private window joins again. A closes
   the room: B's page clears and says only "The host closed the room". A
   opens a room again: the old link says no room is open.

## CI

| Stage | Trigger | Runs | On failure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PR | push to a PR | lint; unit and conformance (Node and browser); integration on Linux, macOS, Windows; web build | blocks merge |
| main | merge | all of PR, e2e on three platforms, nightly installers, relay deploy | blocks the nightly build and the deploy |
| Nightly | schedule | the `stress` job, 30 minutes of random seeds | fails the run |
| Release | version tag | all of main, draft release | blocks publishing |

- A PR that changes `spec/` changes `spec/conformance/` too.
- The nightly is built, and the relay with the teammate's page and the
  preview's buddies' model deployed,
  only when `npm test`, `npm run test:stress` and `npm run test:perf` pass
  too (`release` and `relay` in `.github/workflows/desktop.yml`).
- A test that fails now and then is a bug, in the code or the test: it is
  fixed, never retried or skipped. Each relay a test starts is its own,
  with nothing kept on disk (`test/relay/harness.js`), so a limit one test
  fills never refuses another.
- CI holds no model API keys.

## CD

- Channels: **nightly** (every main), **beta** and **stable** (tags). A
  release is drafted by CI and published by a person.
- Installers: macOS dmg (signed and notarized), Windows NSIS, Linux AppImage.
- The app follows semver. The format's major changes only with the spec,
  its fixtures and a note on what happens to old files.

## Stretch goals

- **Clean install**: installing the signed app on a clean VM and running the
  main flow before each release.
- **Real agents**: run the shipped Claude Code and Codex scripts for real,
  to catch a program changing its flags. First by hand before a release on
  the maintainer's own subscription; later a weekly CI run with a
  subscription token. No pay-per-token API key.
- **Auto-update**: needs a macOS Developer ID; checking is a network call,
  so off by default, and it applies only when the app quits.
