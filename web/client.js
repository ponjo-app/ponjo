// Interfaces; docs/markdown-view.md, Many writers, plan A): the view's typing
// goes to the host as operations on the rev it started from, one edit at a
// time: at once when none is on its way, else all typed meanwhile once the
// host answers. Others' edits come back as operations, moved over the typing
// not landed yet and shown with the view's applyText, once any IME
// composition has ended: a change in the text being composed would break
// it, and what was composed would be lost. The same for every
// view, and for the two-writer harness (test/collab/page.js).

 * Keep `view` ({ getText, selection, composing? }) in the host's order: `call(type,

 * shows others' edits, `ops` as they changed the view's text, `event` the
 * host's `ops` event (null for the edits of a host that started again);
 * `caughtUp(state)` hears the host's `state` each catch-up brings,
 * `onLine(online)` whether the line to the host is up: false once a call
 * fails as `offline`, true again once the page has caught up; `onLanded()`
 * that all the view's typing has landed, as `idle()` may say.
 * Start it with the host's `state`; call `edited()` on every change the
 * person makes in the view, and `moved()` when their caret moves; give it
 * each `ops` and `cursors` event, and `catchUp()` on a new connection.
 * A view that composes calls `edited()` when its composition ends.
