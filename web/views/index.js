// The built-in views, and which one a doc opens in. A view is a doc's editor:
// the one thing here that has state (caret, undo, what is drawn), so it is
// built in, not extended. A view gives one format an editor of its own, with its UI and
// settings, and can be switched off. It is a declaration: { id, name, about (one
// line), extensions (null: any file no other view claims), always (true: cannot
// be switched off), createView (options → a view, see web/views/plain/view.js),
// settings: [field, ...] }, a field being { key, type, label, hint?, default,
// group?, when? } and shown in this order on the view's page in Settings:
// - type 'switch' (a boolean), 'choice' (one of `options`: [[value, label], ...])
//   or 'number' (an integer from `min` to `max`, by `step`, with a `unit`?);
// - `group`, on the first field of a group, is the group's heading;
// - `when`, { key: value | [values] } or { key: { not: value } } on the view's
//   other fields, shows the field only then.
// The view's own tools (toolbar, outline, focus mode) are part of it and
// switched by its settings; every view passes the one contract in
// test/views.test.js. To add a view, write one in a folder here and list it in
// VIEWS. A doc opens in the view that is on and claims its extension, else in
// the Plain text view, for any text file.
//
// A view keeps its latency promise (docs/architecture.md, Latency) only up to
// a size, its `limits`: { chars, the doc's length, and blockChars, the
// longest run of text without a blank line }. A doc past them opens in the
// Plain text view, unless the person chooses the view anyway; past the Plain
// text view's limits too, it opens read-only. The Plain text view colours
// syntax only while no run is past its colorBlockChars.

 * arriving to it shown, the network aside (B4); from a key to its character
 * shown at a teammate, while the person types on, the network aside (B5);
 * from a person's cursor moving to it shown at the others (B6); the
 * longest the page is ever busy at once after it opens (B7); and from a
 * file clicked in the sidebar to its doc drawn in place of the one before,
 * for a doc of everyday size (B8, `switch`).
 * test/perf/latency.test.js holds every view to it at its limits,
 * test/perf/typing.test.js the key to the file and to a teammate's page,
 * test/perf/open.test.js a file opened from the sidebar,
